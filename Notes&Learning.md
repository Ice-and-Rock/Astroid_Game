Additions based on feedback:
- ✅ Add a 'game over' message when when asteroid and triangle collide.
    - capture the collision in a variable (boolean) and render if true
    - The origional message was nested inside the ```collisionChecker``` . 2hrs spent. Doh!
- ✅ Add a re-start button after GameOver
    - Done but it's not a button, you click the screen to re-start
- Add a score counter
    - create a variable called 'score'
    - add 1 to score each time an asteroid contacts the projectile
- speed up asteroids more
    - change VX / VY values (velocity of asteroid)
